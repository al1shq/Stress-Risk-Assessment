        <p class="u-text u-text-4">Stress can be defined as a state of worry or mental tension caused by a difficult situation. Stress is a natural human response that prompts us to address challenges and threats in our lives. Everyone experiences stress to some degree. The way we respond to stress, however, makes a big difference to our overall well-being.</p>

        <h2 class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-font-ubuntu u-text u-text-default u-text-1">Eustress</h2>
        <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-font-ubuntu u-text u-text-2">A positive form of stress that is linked with feelings of excitement, enthusiasm, and fulfillment. This type of stress is beneficial and can inspire motivation. It tends to be short-term and is brought about from positive events such as attainting one's goals, major ​achievements, and exercise. Eustress results in positive feelings, increased engery, improved performance, as well as a sense of self-fulfillment.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-font-ubuntu u-text u-text-3">Distress</h2>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-4">A negative form of stress that has harmful effects on both physical and mental health. It can either be long-term or short-term and is associated with negative and overwhelming events that an individual is unable to effectively cope with. Distress can result in mental health conditions such as depression, fatigue, sleep disturbances, increased irritability, headaches, high blood pressure, and decreased performance.</p>

        <h3 class="u-custom-font u-font-ubuntu u-text u-text-default u-text-2">Psychosocial</h3>
        <p class="u-custom-font u-font-ubuntu u-text u-text-3"> Psychosocial stress is caused by social situations. It can be characterized by social evaluation (judgment from others), exclusion, or achievement-oriented feelings. Common symptoms include: sweating, anxiety, changes in mood, inability to relax, feeling tense/ unhappy, and social withdrawal. </p>
        <h3 class="u-align-right u-custom-font u-font-ubuntu u-text u-text-4">Family</h3>
        <p class="u-align-right u-custom-font u-font-ubuntu u-text u-text-5"> Personal stress can be caused by a variety of environmental factors, however, the most common causes include financial hardships, arguments, and familial expectations. This can be closely related to chronic stress as family dynamics do not change frequently. Common symptoms can include changing family dynamics, headaches, irritability, muscle tension, changes in communication patterns, mood swings, and changes in routine.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        </p>
        <h3 class="u-custom-font u-font-ubuntu u-text u-text-default u-text-6">Academic</h3>
        <p class="u-custom-font u-font-ubuntu u-text u-text-7"> Academic stress is the most common type experienced in high school students and can stem from family expectations and a high-level of conscientiousness, or perfectionism. Key causes can include intense workloads, competitive environments, performance pressure, time constraints, and fear of failure. Symptoms can manifest emotionally, physically, and cognitively: headaches and migraines, fatigue, indigestion, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, mood swings, burnout, loss of motivation, forgetfulness, and procrastination. Some related symptoms can include disordered eating, social withdrawal, depersonalization, increased likelihood of ulcers, isolation, and poor academic performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        </p>
        <h3 class="u-custom-font u-font-ubuntu u-text u-text-default u-text-8">Lifestyle</h3>
        <p class="u-align-right u-custom-font u-font-ubuntu u-text u-text-9"> Lifestyle stress refers to physical and emotional strains caused by unhealthy choices and habits, as well as health-related issues. Some common causes include: poor work/life balance, unhealthy diets, lack of physical activity, inadequate sleep, and substance abuse. Of course, this can also be caused by medical conditions that may not directly relate to cognitive function, but cause stress nonetheless. Symptoms can include fatigue, muscle tension, indigestion, weight changes, weakened immune system, frequent illnesses, low self-esteem, and neglecting responsibilities.</p>

        <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-font-ubuntu u-text u-text-3"> Acute stress can be experienced on a daily basis from minor situations. This type of stress is short-term and usually fades quickly once the stressor is removed. Some common causes of acute stress can include traffic jams, crowds, loud noises, impending deadlines, speeches, and so on. Symptoms such as anxiety, nail biting, sweating, and increased heart rate are resolved quickly.&nbsp;<br>
        </p>
        <h2 class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-font-ubuntu u-text u-text-default u-text-4">episodic acute</h2>
        <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-font-ubuntu u-text u-text-5"> Episodic Acute stress is when an individual experiences acute stress much more frequently than the average person. It is important to note, however, that episodic acute stress is not chronic. Instead, it has the ability to go out of control and become chronic stress or a more severe form. Episodic Acute stress can stem from too much responsibility, demanding jobs, family ​responsibilities, and overthinking. The symptoms are shared with acute stress, but to a higher degree. This type of stress can have even more harmful effects on your physical and mental wellbeing, such as increased cholesterol, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, digestive problems, weight gain, and depression.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        </p>
        <h2 class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-font-ubuntu u-text u-text-default u-text-6">Chronic</h2>
        <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-font-ubuntu u-text u-text-7"> Chronic stress is extremely persistent and has significant, long-term impacts on individuals, especially high school students whose minds are still developing. It is brought about due to inadequate coping mechanisms poor lifestyle habits, as well as prolonged stressors such as academic performance and chronic health conditions. Additionally, chronic stress can often drive individuals to resort to substance abuse as a coping mechanism. The most common symptoms include persistent anxiety, insomnia, hypertension, addiction, impaired cognitive function, and chest pains.&nbsp;<br>
